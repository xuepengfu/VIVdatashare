# VIVdata

Including two main parts: VIV experiment results and numercial codes.

The first paper have been submitted to airxiv now. For the first phase, we introduced three steady flow cases: uniform flow case, linearly sheared flow case and bidirectionally sheared flow case.

There were two uniform flow cases that have been conducted in the past, we choose one of there two test.

The two folders contain the experiemntal data `Experimental_results` and numerical code `CFD_codes`.

## VIV Experiment Results `Experimental_results`
Experiments are conducted at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), and the data will be available after negotiation with clients.

Three cases of uniform flow case, linearly sheared flow case and bidirectionally sheared flow case are uploaded after  acceptance.

## VIV Numerical Codes
VIV codes is 2D strip method based on Euler beam with constant tension.

OpenFOAM-8 is required. (OpenFOAM changes a lot in different versions transition, we may choose a more stable CFD solver in the future)

Matlab 2018 works OK for this case.
